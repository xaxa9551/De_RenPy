# De_RenPy
UnRPA + UnRPYC + CMD = De_RenPy [afternoon project]

This is something i put together to **speed up** and **Â¿simplify?** decompiling RenPy games using UNRPA and UNRPYC. Hopefully other souls will find it at least slightly usefull. 

**De_RenPy requires:**  
Python 3.x for unrpa
Python 2.7 for unrpyc
Unrpyc-master in root directory (Download - https://github.com/CensoredUsername/unrpyc)  
Unrpa (installed from pip (pip install unrpa))

unrpyc forler should be in De_RenPy folder (clone this repo, cd in it, clone unrpyc repo).  

When everything is ready just run **De_RenPy.bat** and go 1,2,3 wild.

Menu:  
**(1) - Runs UnRPA** (shows list of .rpa files in **01_Input_RPA** and decompile all of them)  
**(2) - Runs UnRPYC** (specify folder **<02_Output_RPA>** or **<03_Input_RPYC>** from where .rpyc will be decompiled to **<04_Output_RPYC>**)  
**(3) - Copy all .rpa files from game folder** (lets say DDLC at **C:\Users\whosyourdaddy\Desktop\DDLC**. This will copy all .rpa files it will find in given game)  
**(4) - Cleans all contents of subfolders** (**01_Input_RPA , 02_Output_RPA , 03_Input_RPYC , 04_Output_RPYC**)  
**(5) - Exits this mess**
